Versus Wednesdays are a weekly fighting game meetup to challenge other players in various fighting games and level up as a community.\
Casual matches and building an offline environment to play fighting games in Basel are the main focus.\
Every last Wednesday of the month is replaced by a [Monthly Mash Tournament](/monthly-mash)!

Beginners are welcome!

We usually have 3-4 setups (2x PS4/PS5 and 1x PC) with a variety of games.\
There's two fight sticks in case you want to try or forgot your own. (Thanks Marco)\
There is an entry fee of 5.- which is used for the venue and prize pools.\
